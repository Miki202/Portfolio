# Goodreads Dataset Analysis Project

## Overview
This project was my final project for the course in Applied Statistics at FMI. It focused on analyzing the **Goodreads dataset**.
The dataset, provided by Soumik (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jealousleopard/goodreadsbooks), 
includes information about books, authors, publishers, and reviews on the Goodreads platform, owned by Amazon. 
This analysis aims to derive insights about different book trends (e.g. book ratings, author productivity, etc.).

## Features
- Loads and preprocesses the Goodreads dataset.
- Generates summary statistics and checks for missing values.
- Performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset better.
- Visualizes key findings, such as:
  - Top-rated books
  - Trends in book publication over the years, etc.
- Conducts normality tests on ratings and examines correlations between different variables.
- Provides insights and conclusions based on the analysis.

## Technologies Used
- **R**: Core programming language for analysis.
- **tidyverse**: For data manipulation and visualization.
- **ggplot2**: For creating informative and aesthetically pleasing plots.
- **corrplot**: For visualizing correlation matrices.
- **R Markdown**: For documenting and presenting the project.

## Project Structure and Explanation of Files
- **Books_Project.Rmd**: An R Markdown file containing the analysis code and narrative.
- **Books_Project_R.Rmd**: An R file containing the project code.
- **Pics_Project_Statistics.zip**: A .zip folder containing the graphs from the analysis.
